Gulp Boilerplate
================

I build a lot of sites that follow the same formats, same requirements and same types of functionality. So to save myself some time I created this boilerplate.
I had a colleague that requested I make this public so that others could use. So here it is.

Set up
------

This is straight forward to set up.

1. Open the project in your favourite editor and update lines 2 and 3 in the package.json file.
2. Make sure you have npm, node and gulp installed on your machine and then run npm install
3. Install the chrome add on for 'live reload'
4. Turn live reload on and start coding.

Pull requests
-------------

This format might not cover everyones requirements. If you think something could be improved feel free to fork and submit a pull request.
